# Project Hercules

## Demo
[Android](https://github.com/Grumfyyy/Project-Hercules/releases/tag/apk)

## So what is Project Hercules?

Project Hercules is a crossplatform fitness application that helps track gym progress and food intake.
All progress is stored locally meaning i as a developer can't reach the daily progress.

## Why was it developed?

Tracking progress in the gym and in the kitchen with paper and pen is something i've seen and something i don't like to do when tracking my progress 
so therefor as software developer student, i wanted to test my ability to develop something from an issue to a solution.
